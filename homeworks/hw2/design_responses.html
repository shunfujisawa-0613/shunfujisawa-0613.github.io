							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something that I learnt from this article was that the padding should be a multiple of 8. I used padding in other design elements before, but I was unawaure that a padding with a multiple of 8 brings clarity and intention to the design. I do want to know why this is the case though. </p>
