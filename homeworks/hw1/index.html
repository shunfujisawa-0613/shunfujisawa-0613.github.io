        <p><strong><h1>Part 2: Reading Responses</h1></strong></p>

        <ul>
            <li> 1. I learnt the fundemental strucutre of apps and how we can replicate them. As the article states, it tells us that we should look at apps that we use and learn from it. I really liked the AirBnB example alot, and I think that the examples really aided my understanding. I also learnt 4 important points in an app, hierarchy, content, intent, and audience.</li>
            <li> 2. My favourite part in this article were the gifs. They were so helpful to understand the points that the author was making. Breaking down an app UI visibly helped me underestand the reason and the strucutral components.</li>
            <a href ="https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-develop-an-eye-for-design-c5a4c64bb26c"><li> 3. "open up an app and think through the reasons why the designers chose to design it that way" </li></a>
        </ul>
