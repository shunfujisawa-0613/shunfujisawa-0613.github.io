							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I found it interesting to read about using the depth of color as a way to communicate with the viewrs. I think that my first impression would be to just use different colors, but using different shades and such was very intersting. I think I would try to implement it in my next design! </p>
