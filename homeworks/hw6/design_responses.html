						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I think the speed of the animation was something I never thought about but something I noticed before. I think making animations are crucial in any website or app, but the speed of it was like something I never fully thought about. The diagram with the speed of good animation duration is definetly something I will use in the future. </p>
						</li>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> The various animations embedded in the website was very useful. They really accelrated my understanding! I think, again, the speed diagram was very very useful with the animations too!  </p>
