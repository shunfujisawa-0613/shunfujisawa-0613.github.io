                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I think what I mainly learnt from this article is the use of transitions. Yes, making a button functional is important, but adding transitions seems to add a level of depth to the website as a whole. It feels more professional and well made. </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I really liked the website homescreen with the text "dark." The animation for it was really cool to see, and I want to be able to animate my websites like that! The examples are all really cool too.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I think my favourite was again the website with the "dark" text. The website's background changed as the cursors moved, and I felt that it was really cool to see. Im not entirely sure how to code it, but the idea was very cool. It was like the website for Apple where the movement of the screen influences the animation on the screen. </p>

                            <p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? Please briefly explain why.</p>
                            <p> 10, I think the gallery of imges and animations really inspired alot of creativity. I want to use these animations in the future.</p>
